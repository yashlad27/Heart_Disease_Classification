    "# Predicting heart disease using machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "this notebook looks into using various python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "we are going to take the following approach:\n",
    "1. Problem definition\n",
    "2. data\n",
    "3. Evaluation\n",
    "4. features\n",
    "5. modelling\n",
    "6. experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition:\n",
    "In a statement,\n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data:\n",
    "Original data came from the Cleveland data from the UCI Machine learning Repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a version of it available on Kaggle.\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we will pursue the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features:\n",
    "This is where you get different information about each features in our data.\n",
    "***create a data dictionary:***\n",
